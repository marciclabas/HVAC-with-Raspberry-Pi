# HVAC with Raspberry Pi
## Abstract

This project consists in implementing a Raspberry Pi as a microcontroller for the heating and air-conditioning system of our apartment. All of the machinery is already set up: boiler, fan coil, radiators and motorized shutter-vents, which are as of now controlled by an Arduino.

To begin with, the system will be controlled directly using SSH, but we plan on expanding the interface to an HTTP API (perhaps to be used from an Android App), an on-site screen (probably akin to the one used now with the Arduino, connected using RS-232 serial protocol) and an I2C connection with a couple Arduino slaves.

The project is being developed by my dad, Josep Claramunt, and myself, Marcel Claramunt.
